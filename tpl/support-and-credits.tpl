        <h1>How to book</h1>

        <p><b>To make a booking:</b> Log in and then on the calendar, scroll down to find the day you want your booking to start to make sure the equipment you want is available. Then click the grid square beside the equipment you want and underneath the hour you want your booking to start. This brings up the create new reservation screen. On this screen, you can set the end time and date for your booking, you can add more equipment to the same booking (click on More Resources), and you can add accessories (fruit pickers and picking bags, which we have plenty of). Click Create to make your booking.</p>
        <p>You can filter by resource type on the left side to make finding your equipment easier.</p>
        <p>You'll receive a confirmation email in a few moments with details on your booking and details on how and where to pick up your equipment. Kimberley and Cranbrook equipment is stored in sheds with combination locks at the Kimberley Open Gate Garden or the Cranbrook Public Produce Garden, so you can pick it up whenever you like. Fernie equipment is stored at the Wildsight office, so you'll need to make arrangements to pick it up.</p>
        <p>Please make sure to return your equipment clean and on time!</p>
